Catalogue of design patterns for board-based collaborative work management tools

There are four different documents in this repository, briefly explained below:

1. Folder "styles-detailed-description": In the paper "Design Patterns for Board-based Collaborative Work Management Tools", we propose eight style patterns for clasifying boards of collaborative work management tools (specifically Trello). For obvious space limitations, in the paper we only explain the general pattern elements, a very high level description of each one and a brief paragraph summary explaining its use. In this folder, we go into detail with each element that define each pattern, explaining all its components at a very low level in each corresponding file for each style.

2. Folder "styles-graphic-language-representation": In this folder we have a representation of each pattern, using our proposed graphic language.

3. "trello-scrapping.csv": In this csv file you can find the actual scrapping of www.trello.com/templates on the date that the paper was submitted (4th December 2020). This scrapping returns the whole list of templates that can be used in the cited workstream collaborative tool. The 91 templates analyzed by us in the paper were obtained with a similar scrapping about a year before (February 2019 approximately). In this file you can take a look at the actual 230 templates created in Trello (including the previous 91), with their names, link and description among other elements.

4. "trello templates clasification.xlsx": This file contains the clasification of the 91 analyzed Trello templates divided in three sheets. The first one show the raw clasification, with one row for each template and an "X" in the column of the pattern(s) in which it is classified. In the other sheets there are both summary tables in which you can clearly see the distribution of templates in our proposed patterns (how many templates are there for each pattern?) and the multiple pattern combinations (when a template contains more than one pattern). This file is the base of "Table 2" and much of Section 5 of the paper.
