**Pattern Name and classification/type:**	KANBAN

**Also known as/alias:** -

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** Using this pattern we will have a full vision of the status of the tasks of a project, handling how they evolve and monitoring them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solutions:** Firstly, cards are storaged in “to do” bucket as tasks are storaged in a backlog. Tasks will flow through the buckets as long as they are in progress or finished in real life. Kanban board will represent the status of every task at any given moment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (Problem):** Controlling the evolution of tasks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Enterprises with projects structured by steps and evolutive tasks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** We can have multiple Kanban boards in parallel (for different projects) or concatenated boards (when a task is finished in one board, it passes to the “to do” bucket in next board).


**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:**
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** There are three buckets that represent three different posible status of a task: “to do”, “doing” and “done”. Cards represent process’ tasks that flow between those buckets according to its evolution in the Project context. “Doing” bucket could be extended in more than one bucket, like for example “

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** Each employee has to move its assigned tasks through the different buckets by the time that he/she works or finishes it. The project manager is the responsible of adding the tasks and assigning them to the different employees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Regulardly, cards follow a linear flow, from left bucket (“to do”) to the right one (“done”) passing by “doing” step.


**Related Patterns:** - 

**Examples/Known uses:** Scrum, factory pipeline.

**Implementation:** Lists aren’t necessary as such, if your tool doesn’t provide them. You can use columns or buckeets for storing the tasks as long as tasks can flow between those lists. Alike, tasks can be represented by tickets for example, in stead of cards.
