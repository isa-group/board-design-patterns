**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Assigned Information

**Also known as/alias:** - 

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** Using this pattern we will have a view of the information of the project at each moment. This information can evolve, change its status and move to another list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solution:** We will store the information in lists and we will move it through the different lists according to the needs of the specific problem, determining the meaning of the card flow in that context (because there is not an established precedence between lists).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Projects with non-static information and without an established order/precedence between lists (topics or phases for example).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (problem):** Representing information divided in not specifically ordered lists (the flow between the different lists is not determined a priori as if we have ordered steps of a project where the requirements phase is always before development phase).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** We can concatenate different Assigned Information boards as an information pipeline.

**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:**



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Cards represent information that can flow between lists. Lists are divisions without a specific relationship order between them (for example, the different departments of an enterprise do not have an a priori established movement order).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** We can have two scenarios: somebody moves all board’s cards (for example, the boss is responsible to move each worker to its assigned department) or each person move its own cards.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Cards can flow between lists without a priori restrictions (they should be specified by the context of the problem)
