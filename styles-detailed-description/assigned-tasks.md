**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Assigned Tasks

**Also known as/alias:** - 

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** This pattern is mainly intended for organizing the task of a team, assigning them to each employee/group member (other uses can fit with this pattern, we only propose an example for explaining it)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solution:** Each list will represent a team member (or an unordered phase, without an established precedence with each other) and tasks will be represented by cards. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Team projects when we want to focus on the assignment (not on the status of the task as in kanban) or when the evolution of the task is not a priori established (as in kanban, where we have a predetermined and ordered flow)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (problem):** Organizing tasks without a pre-established flow (not a pipeline or an ordered sequence)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** We can represent different departments in different boards and we can concatenate tasks from one board to another.

**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:**



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Lists store tasks (cards) without order or precedence relationship between the lists, allowing the flow of tasks between them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** The project manager can distribute the tasks between his/her employees (moving cards from one list (employee) to another) or each employee is responsible of managing its own tasks and moving them to the next employee when finishes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Cards can flow between lists without an a priori established order (because there is not order precedence between lists). Tasks might not follow always the same path.

**Related Patterns:** -

**Examples/Known uses:** Enterprise task assignment to employees (when tasks are not finished by one employee and they have to pass by more than one person)

**Implementation:** It is highly recommended to have some instantiation rules that specify the flow of cards in the board in your specific problem context. Just because there is not order precedence between lists does not mean that the card flow is free and unrestricted; you must specify it.
