**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Information Lifecycle

**Also known as/alias:** - 


**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** This pattern will allow you to view all the information of your project structured by its status while you will be able to control its evolution too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solution:** Having a full view of the evolutive information of your project, represented by cards, structured by its corresponding step in the context of the project, divided by lists.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Projects with a lot of information that changes with the evolution of the processes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (problem):** Representing all needed information of a process differentiating it according to the status of the information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** As in Kanban, we could concatenate multiple Information Lifecycle boards as a pipeline, joining many processes from different boards.


**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Lists frequently represent steps of a whole process while cards represent information that flow between those lists.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** For a lonely use, you will manage all cards and you will move it all. If you are working in a team, probably you will be only responsible of your cards (the information corresponding to your part of the whole project).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Cards will flow between lists as the information evolve in real life and it passes from one step (list) to another. 


**Related Patterns:** -

**Examples/Known uses:** An information pipeline or a BPMN.

**Implementation:** The use of this pattern is quite similar to Kanban, but representing information instead of tasks. We can represent almost any type of information with this board, with labels, images or tags, depending on the features of the specific software that we are using.
