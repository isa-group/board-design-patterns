**Pattern Name and classification/type:**  PROCESS TASKS 

**•	Problem:**  Situations or projects in which we have to provide a sequenced task guide, divided according to the different stages that make up the project. 

**•	Motivation:** We will use this pattern when we want to detail the tasks to be done to make up a project. With this pattern we want to focus on the task list, not in the state of each task at each moment (as in a Kanban). One of the most frequent uses of this pattern is enumerating all the steps (tasks) that wwe have to do for completing a step of a project, represented in the lists. When we complete all tasks of all lists, we would have completed the project. 

**•	Solution and graphic representation:**  Each list represents a phase of the process that we are representing with the whole board, while cards are the tasks of each phase. In this way, we will provide the user a sequenced guide for completing the process, as the steps of a recipe.

In this pattern we are representing the six phases in which the project is divided. In each list we have al the task that we have to do for completing the phase. Phases are ordered, in this case, temporarily, by the time in real life that each phase occurs and their precedences (Pre-Sprint Prep is before Understand, Understand is before Diverge...)

In this template we have six lists, for representing the six phases in which we divide this other project. They are ordered as in the previous example, following the same behaviour. 

**•	Related Patterns discussion:**

This pattern is quite similar to Kanban, but in this pattern the cards don’t flow between lists. We will choose Kanban if we want to focus on the evolution of each card, while we will choose “Process Task” if we want to have “to-do” lists of tasks for each phase of the project, following a determined order, but without managing its evolution with the time. 

“Process Tasks” is also similar to “Categorized Tasks” with the difference that in the first pattern the lists follow an established order (in the two examples showed above, this precedence is temporal), while in the second one, they generally represent independent topics, without relationship or precedence between them.
