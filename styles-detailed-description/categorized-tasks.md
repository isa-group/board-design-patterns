**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Categorized Tasks

**Also known as/alias:** - 

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** Using this pattern we will organize tasks by topic, normally for lonely use (not for team projects).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solution:** We will structure our board according to the different topics of our specific problem, dividing the board in lists (one for each topic) and we will store the tasks of each topic in their corresponding list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Topics or steps mutually exclusive and tasks without evolution control (as in a kanban for example).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (problem):** Representing tasks without relationship between them and structuring them with a meaning (topics for example).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** Note that if there is some relationship between the lists in which we are dividing our problem, we are using Process Tasks board. Here the different columns of our board are unrelated. 

**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:** 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Lists represent topics or excluding steps and cards represent tasks that belong to one and only one list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** It is frequently designed for lonely usage, where the only person that uses the board can add, delete and edit lists and cards as he/she needs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** As cards do not evolve or flow between lists, it is not necessary human intervention with the board once created, beyond editing them if necessary.

**Examples/Known uses:** Getting Things Done (GTD) – A productivity methodology

**Implementation:** It is really important to choose an appropriate division of lists (they have to be exlusives between them) and specify low level tasks for easing their realization in real life.
