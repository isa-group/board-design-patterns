**Pattern Name and classification/type:**  ORDERED INFORMATION 

**•	Problem:**  Situations or projects in which we have to organize information in lists that follow some kind of sorting criteria. 

**•	Motivation:** We will use this pattern when we want to clasify information and there is a relevant order for prioritizing that resources and we need to focus not only in the classification, but also in the order between the categories. One of the most frequent uses of this pattern is having an editorial calendar (as shown in the first example), or some variant of this, as for example representing people instead of temporal divisions. This pattern will allow the user to manage static information with a determined order. 

**•	Solution and graphic representation:**  Each list represents a possible subdivision for storing the information, as for example temporal divisions (weeks, months…). These lists must be ordered or have some precedence relationship, not as in “Categorized Information”, where topics are completely independents. Each card will be stored in one and only one list, without flow between different lists.

In this pattern we are representing an annual editorial calendar. Each list is a month of the year, and into each one we will put the publications of that period, represented by the cards. We will be able to add all relevant information of the publication in the card elements (due date, writer or platform of publication, for example). As months are ordered, following the natural order of the calendar, we use “Ordered Information” instead of “Categorized Information”. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**o	Freelance Branding Project**

In this template we have the phases of a project representated in the lists. User has all the information of each step into the list, explaining what does it has to do and detailing each concept in the context of this project. We have all the stages since the discovery of a new costumer to the delivery of the work, ordering all the intermediate phases. Each card contains information about each phase requirements, for helping the user to know what and how does it have to do its work. 

**•	Related Patterns discussion:**

This pattern is quite similar to “Categorized Information”, differing from each other in whether there ir presence or abscence of order between the lists. We will choose one or another depending on what do we want to represent in the list: for example, if we represent months, as in the first example of this pattern, we will use “Ordered Information”, because the months have a determined order. Nevertheless, if we are going to represent independent topics, without any type of rank between them, we will use “Categorized Information”.
