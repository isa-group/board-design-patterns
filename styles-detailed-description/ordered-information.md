**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Ordered Information

**Also known as/alias:** -

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** Using this pattern we will have a full vision of the static information of the project ordered by categories or steps (related between them by a specific precedence).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **•	Solution:** This pattern will be used similar to Process Tasks pattern, but storing information instead of tasks, where cards are in one and only one list which is related with the others (order or precedence relationship).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **•	Context/Applicability:** Projects with many information and related clasifications of it (order, sequenced stages…) or calendar usage (lists represent temporal divisions as days, weeks or months).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **•	Motivation (problem):** Clasify ordered, related and static information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** In this pattern we do not have isolated notes by topic, as in categorized information. Here, the different lists have a precedence or order relationship, although cards do not flow between them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Information will be represented in cards, storaged in lists that can represent order, precedence, days, weeks, different stages of a project…

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** Somebody adds the information to lists, and as it will not evolve (flow is not allowed), human intervention will be unnecessary once created.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Cards do not flow between lists, so we use this pattern like Process Tasks pattern, but storing information instead of tasks.

**Examples/Known uses:** Calendar

**Implementation:** This pattern does not allow card flow, so if you are going to use it for a calendar, for example, when you place a card for a due date, you will not be able to move it to another day (if you do not do it in time or if you reorganize your agenda).
