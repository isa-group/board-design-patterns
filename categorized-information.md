**Pattern Name and classification/type:** Categorized Information

**Also known as/alias:** - 

**Pattern definition:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Overview/Description:** Using this pattern we will organize all the information of our project by the field that we need (topic, departament, employee…), helping to find it easily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Solutions:** Each bucket will be used as a list of notes, where the cards will be storaged. They will separate the information according to one criteria selected by the Enterprise according to the concrete context (topic, departament…). Cards will be assigned to one and only one bucket, statically, and displaying the information depending on the tool’s features (only text, tags, date…).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Context/Applicability:** Static information based context or projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Motivation (problem):** Having an organized and quick access to the information of a project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Issues/Consequences/resulting context:** It’s unusual to concatenate multiple boards with this pattern, because cards will not flow between them. They would act like parallel projects without interaction between their components.

**Pattern model:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Graphic representation:** 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Components description:** Buckets will be used as containers of information. This information will be collected in the cards as text. Details and additions (use of tags, variables of each card…) will be determined by the software used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Participants description:** It depends on the purpose of use of the board. For example, the project manager should manage all the cards, meanwhile an employee only can act (edit, add tags, write…) over the information of its assigned bucket.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**•	Collaboration/behaviour:** Regulardly, cards doesn’t flow between buckets, so the only possibility of interacting with board’s components is editing the information of the cards or adding features as tags or dates.

**Related Patterns:** -

**Examples/Known uses:** notes clasified by topic or information structured by category.

**Implementation:** Cards of information can be as complex and detailed as the tool allows. In some workstream collaboration tools you can only write text as information, but in some other software you can use tags, dates, you can assign the card to a concrete person… Those functionalities don’t change the essence of the pattern, they only add richness to its usage.
